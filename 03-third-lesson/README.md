# Third Lesson - Go Functions

A broader explanation on functions with Go.

- Named Return Values: functions that don't require to specify the name of the returned variable. 

- Variadic Functions: allows a function to take zero or more values of the same type (similar to array).

- High-order functions: functions that take one or more functions as arguments.
